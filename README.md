# European Macroeconomic Dashboard
> **My first Github project!**

Analysing macroeconomic data with Eurostat datasets (between 2015 and 2022) to uncover trends and statistical insights relevant in modern Europe's banking and financial markets decision-making. I've analysed a few key macroeconomic factors - **GDP growth**, **inflation**, and **unemployment** — across Euro area countries. By leveraging datasets, Python, and its powerful libraries, I was able to apply myself to real-world economic data that impacts financial institutions.

## Key Features

- ✅ Aggregated and harmonised Eurostat datasets  
- ✅ Descriptive statistics of GDP, inflation, unemployment  
- ✅ Correlation matrix analysis of macroeconomic indicators  
- ✅ Clear visualisations

## Example Output

**Correlation Matrix Heatmap**  
*(This heatmap shows how GDP growth, inflation, and unemployment are interrelated, essential for market risk forecasting)*
